# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## Smithchart control

Accessibility is achieved in the smith chart control through WAI-ARIA standard. The smith chart features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the smith chart:

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Element</b></td>
<td><b>Default description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Title</td>
<td>Reads the smith chart's title</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Legend</td>
<td>Reads the series name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maker</td>
<td>Reads the Location x :  Location y value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Series Points</td>
<td>Reads the Point x :  Point y value</td>
</tr>
</table>
